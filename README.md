Adobe XD Align Justify Text
==============================

For the very first time in the whole world !

Programmed by [Amirhosseinhpv](https://amirhosseinhpv.ir/) in [BlackSwanLab](https://blackswanlab.ir/)

This is first plugin written for Adobe XD to align text objects as justified!

Just select text object and use the 'Justify It' menu from plugins.

You can also use the shotcode **Shift+Ctrl+J** both in Mac and Windows to do the same thing directly and quickly.

This Plugin preserves the original text object and duplicates it and also makes a group and puts two text objects together. You can also use Ctrl+Z or Undo to revert changes.

Â 

We would be deeply happy if you share your experience and challenges, new
feature requests, bug reports and .. while using our plugin with us at
hi@blackswanlab.ir.

Looking forward hearing from you.
